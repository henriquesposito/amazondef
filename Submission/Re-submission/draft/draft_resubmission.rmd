abstract: Presidential speeches can influence the ways people think and act towards the environment , but they are understudied. We propose a framework to investigate how the Brazilian Amazon has been constructed as a problem across time and space. Using supervised machine learning, we classify statements about the Amazon in 6240 transnational presidential speeches since 1985. We find that national and international events drive the frequency at which the topic of the Amazon is mentioned in presidential speeches. While constructing the Amazon as a problem of economic integration are the most common until the mid-2000s, environmental conservation and social development constructions temporarily surpass economic integration from 2010 to 2015. In turn, constructing the Amazon as an issue of sovereignty increases since 2010. Lastly, presidents usually construct the Amazon as an issue of environmental conservation internationally. When speaking within the Amazonian region, presidents tend to construct the Amazon as an issue of social development and economic integration.

We understand claims of sovereignty as a particular problem-construction that touches on imaginaries of external threats to territory. Relatedly, we also understand sovereignty as raising concerns about wrong perspectives and criticism from foreign and non-state actors about government action related to the Brazilian Amazon. In all, it advances the view that the Amazon is Brazilian, foreign, and non-state presence in the region needs to be monitored closely.","This code constructs the Amazon region and/or forest as an issue of economic integration. It advances the view that the Amazon needs to be developed and connected to the national economy. This includes expanding the agricultural frontier through incentives, creating a diverse set of infrastructure (roads, dams, internet, radio, energy), fostering differing industries (tourism, mining, cattle, agriculture and so on) through tax-free zones, as well as facilitating the exploitation of natural resources for developmental purposes.", "This code constructs the Amazon region and/or forest as an issue of social development. It advances the view that Amazon is full of citizens who should have their rights guaranteed. This refers to the construction of schools and universities (right to education), of hospitals (right to health), and of housing (right to house). This also includes guarantees of a dignified life with decent employment, access to water and sanitation, as well as access to electricity, internet, radio, and light. Finally, this includes referrals to culture and the right to vote.", "This code constructs the Amazon region and/or forest as an issue of conservation. This problem-construction focuses on the value of a standing forest and of the preserved ecosystem in the region. The conservationist narrative advances the view that Amazon should be preserved, deforestation should be halted, and the practices of indigenous and traditional populations should be maintained and fostered. It advances the view that the emission of greenhouse gasses should be halted, that renewable energy should be supported, and that protected areas should be created."), Example = c("Congressman, the fundamental link for Brazil to really head in the direction to prosperity. I would like first, Hu Chunhua,  to thank you for the words of your ambassador to Brazil recognizing our sovereignty over the Amazonian region during that recent episode in the G7 meeting.

We, in the Amazon, are connecting Manuas, Boa Vista, Caracarai, until up there, the red line [in a map] that goes all the way up in the direction of Venezuela, that is the so-called  BR-174 highway. This highway will allow production in the Tax Free Zone in Manaus to be competitive, not within, but outside, that is the vocation of the the Tax Free Zone to export; and we can even do it through the Caribbean (Cardoso 02/07/1997)",

In a speech, presidents might mix multiple problem-constructions within an Amazon statement. Mixed-type problem-constructions in discourse offer more intricate understandings of the Amazon as a problem. Constructing the Amazon as multiple issues averages at 18% of all constructions over time. The most frequent mixed-type problem construction of the Amazon is economic conservation. This mixed-type construction, composed of Amazonian statements that construct the Amazon as a problem of both economic integration and environmental conservation, generally increased over time. This increase suggests that later presidents, along with being more diverse in how they construct the Amazon as an issue, increasingly find ways to reconcile the dictum between the economy and the environment that had prevailed in the previous years. The second most common mixed-type mixes social development and economic integration and appears, on average, in 5.4% of all statements. This is not surprising, as developing countries like Brazil repeatedly claim a "right to develop", when it comes to negotiating strong climate commitments and policies with a focus on both social development and economic integration. Nonetheless, there is a general increase of mixed-types over time, which is expected given the rise of global agendas understanding interconnections of social, environmental, and economic domains such as the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, both Lula and Bolsonaro construct the Amazon as a multifaceted issue more frequently than other presidents. Lula usually mixed economic integration with environmental conservation and social development when constructing the Amazon as an issue, while Bolsonaro constructs the Amazon as an issue of national sovereignty and economic integration much more than any other president, mimicking the military dictatorship discourses and policies toward the region [@hecht1990].
